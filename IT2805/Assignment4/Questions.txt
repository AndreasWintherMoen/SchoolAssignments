1.	Why do mobile phones usually ignore auto play on video elements?
This is intentionally added by the OS developers to prevent unwanted use of mobile bandwidth. 

2.	What will the CSS snippet at the end of this section do if the visitor is browsing on a
device with 320 x 568 resolution?
Nothing will happen (the display: none; will not trigger) because the resolution is below the min-device-width.

3.	Mention some of the advantages of having a single responsive website instead of dedicated versions like m.til.no for mobile and til.no for desktop?
Using a single website is easier to administer and with lower cost. By having only one URL mobile users also don't 
have to wait to be redirected to the mobile site which takes time, especially on slower connections.
